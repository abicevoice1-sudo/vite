  privacy: 'Privacy-first by design.\n\n• Photos: Public, hidden until interest, or private until matched.\n• Watermarks + anti-screenshot guards reduce scraping.\n• Incognito mode hides your profile from search.\n• Block/report any member from their profile or chat.\n\nChange anytime in Settings → Privacy.',
  safety: 'Your safety matters.\n\n• Flag any member with ⚠ on their profile/chat — reviewed within 24h.\n• Block instantly from Messages or profile.\n• Never send money, bank details, crypto, or personal identifiers.\n• Red flags: rushing off-app, asking for money, refusing chaperoned calls.\n\nsupport@shiarishta.com',

  onboard: 'Onboarding is dignified and complete.\n\n1. Create account + confirm email.\n2. Set intentions, faith practice, what you seek.\n3. Add halal-appropriate photos — clarity helps matching.\n4. Complete verification when ready.\n5. Browse /profiles with filters: sect, religiosity, education, verified-only.\n\nPause anytime — nothing is forced.',

How do you picture year one?"\n\nAsk open questions, mirror respect, move deeper chats into chaperoned calls once trust is built.',
  community: 'Community spaces for respectful sharing.\n\n• Join subreddit-style groups: /hyderabad, /dallas, /london, /toronto, /reverts, /parents.\n• Post anonymously — your name hidden, post visible.\n• Guests read everything; to comment/post, register or log in.\n• Keep it kind and on-topic.',
  rizz: 'Halal rizz — respectful conversation skills 🌙\n\nBest "rizz": sincerity, attentiveness, dignity.\n\n• "Salam! Your profile made me smile — what do you never get asked?"\n• Compliment a value: "Your take on family stood out."\n• "Tea or coffee? Compatibility question, obviously."\n• Be specific — reference a real detail from their profile.\n• Let family in when right, bring a chaperone once serious.\n\nNo pressure, no love-bombing, no rushing, dignity first.',
  match: 'Better matches on Shiarishta:\n\n• Complete your profile — boosts visibility and ranking.\n• Be specific about intentions, lifestyle, religiosity.\n• Upload clear, halal-appropriate photos.\n• Use /profiles filters: sect, religiosity, education, verified-only, location.\n• Read before reaching out — thoughtful > generic.\n\nCompatibility blends faith, lifestyle, timeline.',
